# forum-app

A forum application that is supposed to be a simple throwback to old school forums, like PHPBB. It's setup like a monorepo: [forum-app/client] (frontend) and [forum-app/server] (backend).

In this forum app, users can register an account, edit their user profile, post and reply threads, and browse the forums. 

The frontend part was made with React and TypeScript as a learning experience, as I've already worked with React/TypeScript before and I wanted to improve my skills.

## Made with

- React
- TypeScript
- Redux
- Node/Express
- GraphQL
- TypeORM
- MongoDB
- Redis
