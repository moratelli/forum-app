# forum-app/client

A client for the forum application that users will interact with, i.e. the frontend. In the client, users can register an account, change passwords, browse various subjects and categories, post threads, reply to threads, and check thread stats. It's supposed to be a simple throwback to old school forums, like PHPBB.

Currently, the client consumes mocked hardcoded data but it will consume data from a real GraphQL API in the near future.
